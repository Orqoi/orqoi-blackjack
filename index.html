						Welcome to blackjack. You will start with $100 and place a bet for each game. After you place your bet the dealer will deal two cards to you, face up and then two cards for itself - one faced down and the other faced up. If you’re dealt a ten-value card and an Ace as your first two cards that means you got a Blackjack! If the dealer also has a Blackjack, you wouldn’t win anything but you also wouldn’t lose your original wager. This is called a “push”. If YOU don’t have a Blackjack AND the dealer doesn’t have a blackjack, your dealer will point to each player in succession and wait for you to decide how you want to play your hand.
						Stand – If your first two cards are acceptable, you can stand and the dealer will move on.
						Hit – If you would like more cards to improve your hand total, the dealer will deal you more cards, one at a time, until you either “bust” (go over 21) or you choose to stand. There is no limit on the number of cards you can take.
						<!-- Double Down – If you have a hand total that is advantageous to you but you need to take an additional card you can double your initial wager and the dealer will deal you only 1 additional card. To be implemented...-->
